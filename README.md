# Delight-Meditate

Delight-Meditate is a free daily Bible reading web app
for mobile devices and desktop web browsers.
It takes you through a daily reading plan
and is designed to be simple, quick, and frictionless.
For each reading, you can read your physical Bible
or, with a single click, view the reading
at one of the popular online Bible web sites,
in your chosen translation.

# Current Status

Delight-Meditate was created several years ago and run in small production for a couple of years.
It was then left on hiatus for a couple of years.
It is currently in the process of being revived.
It has been verified to run locally, but has not yet been put back into production,
nor have the JavaScript artifacts been rebuilt since the hiatus.
